# Gulp

> Gulp setup

Yes we know Gulp isn't the most cutting edge task runner, and that WebPack or something cooler is "better", but we've not got around to converting everything yet, therefore continue to use it until further notice. 

## Setup

If you've not got [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com) installed then head over to their site and follow their instructions. You'll also need [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) so the best way to install that is to download [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).

## Commands

```gulp``` - The easist command to run, it will watch for file amends and compile the code to the theme directory.
